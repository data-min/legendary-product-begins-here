What I am building

- A cloud app that
- streams a live video world to my browser
- reacts to your keyboard/touch (actions)
- remembers changes so the same world can run for an hour and survive restarts

Getting cloud GPU box

- pick google cloud(L4), AWS(L40S/L4), or Runpod(40980/L40S)
- Create a VM in region close to you
- Open firewall for HTTPS + UDP (WebRTC).

You will know it worked when you can SSH into the VM
